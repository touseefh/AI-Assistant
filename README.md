## How It Works
### üîç Web Scraping
- The app uses **Selenium** to scrape text data from multiple pages of Ahdus Technology's website.
- Extracted data is **split into chunks** using LangChain's **CharacterTextSplitter**.
- The processed text is **stored in FAISS** for similarity-based retrieval.

### üì° Query Processing & Response Generation
- When a user submits a query, **FAISS searches** for the most relevant text chunks.
- The **retrieved text is sent to Google Gemini AI**, which generates a structured answer.
- The AI's response is displayed in the chat UI.

### üí¨ Chat UI & Interaction
- Users can **ask questions** through a text input field.
- The assistant **retrieves answers in real time**.
- The **chat history is stored in session state**, allowing users to revisit previous queries.
- A **clear history button** resets the conversation.
